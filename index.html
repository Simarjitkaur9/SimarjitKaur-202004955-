              <h4>Physical description:</h4>
      Roses are erect, climbing, or trailing shrubs, the stems of which are usually copiously armed with prickles of various shapes and sizes, commonly called thorns. The leaves are alternate and pinnately compound (i.e., feather-formed), usually with oval leaflets that are sharply toothed. The flowers of wild roses usually have five petals, whereas the flowers of cultivated roses are often double (i.e., with multiple sets of petals).
             
             <h4>Major species and hybrids:</h4>
     The flowers of the damask rose (Rosa ×damascena) and several other species are the source of attar of roses used in perfumes. Many species, particularly the rugosa rose (R. rugosa), produce edible rose hips, which are a rich source of vitamin C and are sometimes used in preserves. </td>

             <h4>Physical description:</h4>
      The lotus flower is an aquatic perennial. Sometimes mistaken for the water-lily, the lotus has a distinctively different structure. It also only comes in pink hues or white, whereas the lily comes in many different colors. The roots are implanted in the soil of a river or pond, and the leaves float on the surface. In some research reports, the lotus can control the temperature.
      
            <h4>Major species and hybrids:</h4>
      Lotus is the Latin name for a genus of the pea family (Fabaceae), containing about 100 species distributed in temperate regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. </td>

             <h4>Physical description:</h4>
        Each flower has a rosette of small, thin white petals surrounding a bright yellow centre. These are supported by a single stem which grows from a group of dark green rounded leaves. The petals can sometimes be tinged with pink. It is a common wild flower found growing in our garden lawns.
             
             <h4>Major species and hybrids:</h4>
        The name daisy commonly denotes the oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), the Shasta daisy (L. ×superbum), and the English, or true, daisy (Bellis perennis). </td>
